Product description:
A travel planning website for an imaged future where space travel is possible.

Requirements deviations:
We did not implement a undo-redo functionality, as this was regarded unecessary.
We do however allow the user to remove planets already added to their itinerary as well as clear the itinerary list
completely.

Future work:
Firstly, the website's accessibility needs to be improved - as it is now, the background animation interferes with some
other UI elements such as text, causing low contrast. We would also like to add more accessibility options, such as
color visibility settings and font size/UI scale options.

Secondly, the tutorial mode is currently functional but not visually pleasing. More time could be spent on
refining the CSS code to make things such as the tutorial tooltips and highlighted areas look better.
